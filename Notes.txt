	- isListening(): 
		See of the port is actively listening, returns boolean.

	- overflow():

	- peek():
		Peek at a character received on the Rx pin without affecting anything.

	- read(): 
		Read a character received ont the Rx pin.
		Returns the character read or -1 if no char was available.

	- print(char/int/string data): 
		Send data to the Tx pin. Returns the number of bytes written.

	- println():
		print() but with a CRLF at the end.
